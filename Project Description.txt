Patient Management System(PMS):
This Patient Management System (PMS) is a comprehensive system for managing a clinic/hospital, including functionalities for various roles such as receptionist, nurse, and doctor. It uses the MySQL connector to interact with a MySQL database. The database is structured to include tables for credentials, patients, doctors, waiting patients, and previous patient records. The script begins by setting up the necessary tables if they do not already exist. It then offers a login system for users to sign in as either a receptionist, nurse, or doctor. Depending on the user's role, they are given specific functionalities: a receptionist can register new patients, view available doctors, and update patient information.A nurse can record patient vitals, and a doctor can consult patients and update their medical records. Each role-specific function includes user input validation and appropriate database operations to ensure data integrity and facilitate the clinic's workflow.
